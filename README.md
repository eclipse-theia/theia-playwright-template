## Building

Run `yarn` in the root directory of the repository.

## Executing the tests

### Prerequisites

To work with the tests the Theia application under test needs to be running.
Please start your Theia application before running the tests.

### Running the tests headless

To start the tests run `yarn ui-tests` in this directory. This will start the tests in a headless state. There is also a VSCode task available called
`Run all tests in headless mode`.

To only run a single test file, the path of a test file can be set with `yarn ui-tests <path-to-file>` or `yarn ui-tests -g "<partial test file name>"`.
See the [Playwright Test command line documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#command-line).

### Running the tests headful, reporting and debugging

Please check for additional scripts in your `package.json` in order to run tests in headful mode and to generate reports.

To debug a test, open the test file in the code editor and run the `Debug selected test file` configuration inside VS Code.
